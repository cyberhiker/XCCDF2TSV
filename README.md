###STIG Browser Parser###
Instead of just pooping out a TSV, this will be used to create a dynamic web app.
The webapp will format things, and act as a checklist for the public to use.
Comments, tags, annotations, etc.  Social IA!

Coming soon!

The code will be open-source-ish, for folks who'd like to run it on 'offline' networks.
